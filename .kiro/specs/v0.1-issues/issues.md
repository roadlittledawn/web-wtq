## ✅ /admin/entries page

this 404s

## ✅ Edit button on list pages

would like edit button if logged in to quickly access edit quote page

## ✅ site layout

home page has no navigation. add header with links to login/admin pages

## ✅ Auto sluggifying on edit pages

For example, on the create phrase page at http://localhost:8888/admin/entries/create/phrase

the auto generating of slugs on editing pages does not work. it only sets one character before stoppingg. maybe the onblur isn't quite working. let' add button instead for user to indicate when ready to generate

i also see "Authorization token is required" error message sometimes

## ✅ Individual entry pages

These 404. For example this page 404s: /entries/william-gibson-on-disdain-customers

I don't think we need these for now, so let's not link to them in lists

## ✅ Parts of speech enumeration/dropdown

for word entries the part of speech should be a dropdown with an enumerated list of options. that list should be:

- noun
- pronoun
- verb
- adjective
- adverb
- interjection
