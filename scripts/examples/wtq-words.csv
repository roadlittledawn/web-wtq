disabuse,verb,": to free from error, fallacy, or misconception",,,,"DYK: We know the verb ""abuse"" as a word meaning ""to misuse,"" ""to mistreat,"" or ""to revile.""  But when ""disabuse"" first appeared in the early 17th century, there was a sense of ""abuse,"" now obsolete, that meant ""to deceive.""  Sir Francis Bacon, for example, used that sense when he wrote in 1605, ""You are much abused if you think your virtue can withstand the King's power.""  The prefix ""dis-"" has the sense of undoing the effect of a verb, so it's not surprising that ""disabuse"" means ""to undeceive.""  English-speakers didn't come up with the idea of joining ""dis-"" to ""abuse"" all on their own, however.  The English ""disabuse"" is modeled after the French désabuser, formed by appending the prefix dés- to the verb abuser.",

We know that the Greeks used dithyrambos as the word for a poem in honor of Dionysus, but beyond that the origin of the word is unknown. The Greeks also had the adjective dithyrambikos, which gave us our adjective ""dithyrambic,"" meaning ""pertaining to or resembling a dithyramb.""",

The ability of certain individuals to recall images, sounds, or events with uncanny accuracy is a subject of fascination for researchers in the field of psychology. Among notable people reputed to have eidetic memories is the late television comic Jackie Gleason, who reportedly was able to memorize an entire half-hour script in a single read-through.",

enervate,verb,": lacking physical, mental, or moral vigor",,,,"""Enervate"" is a word that some people use without really knowing what it means. They seem to believe that because ""enervate"" seems a little bit like ""energize"" and ""invigorate"" it must share their meaning--when it's actually their antonym. ""Enervate"" comes from the Latin enervare, which is formed from the prefix e-, meaning ""out of,"" and -nervare (from nervus, meaning ""sinew"" or ""nerve""). Etymologically, at least, someone who is enervated is ""out of nerve.""",

erudite,adjective,":possessing or displaying extensive knowledge acquired chiefly from books : profound, recondite, or bookish learning",,,<knowledgeable>,"DIY: ""Erudite"" derives from Latin eruditus, the past participle of erudire, meaning ""to instruct.""  A closer look at the verb shows that it was formed by combining the prefix e-, meaning ""missing"" or ""absent,"" with the adjective rudis, which means ""rude"" or ""ignorant"" and is also the source of our word ""rude.""  We typically use the word ""rude"" to mean ""discourteous"" or ""uncouth,"" but it can also mean ""lacking refinement"" or ""uncivilized.""  Someone who is erudite, therefore, has been transformed from a roughened or uninformed state to a polished and knowledgeable one through a devotion to learning.  Usage Note: erudition strongly implies the acquiring of profound, recondite, or bookish learning <an erudition unusual even in a scholar>",

Even when the term steps outside the courtroom--to be used of an ex parte meeting, interveiw, chat, conversation, investigation, discussion, or contact, for example--the ""one-sided"" sense often has some sort of legal or legislative slant.",

From the novel: ""Grok means to understand so thoroughly that the observer becomes a part of the observed—to merge, blend, intermarry, lose identity in group experience. It means almost everything that we mean by religion, philosophy, and science—and it means as little to us (because of our Earthly assumptions) as color means to a blind man.""",

Eluctari joined e- (""ex"") with luctari, forming a verb meaning ""to struggle clear of."" Ineluctabilis brought in the negative prefix in- to form an adjective describing something that cannot be escaped or avoided. English-speakers borrowed the word as ""ineluctable"" around 1623. Another descendent of luctari is ""reluctant."" Reluctari meant ""to struggle against""--hence someone who is ""reluctant"" resists or holds back.",

The ancients also used omphalos to desginate a boss on a shield (that is, a raised ornamentation) and a rounded altar at Delphi, which was supposed to mark the center of the earth.  In the 19th century, English-speakers borrowed ""omphalos"" for these senses, as well as the more general sense ""center of activity.""  In the 1920s, ""omphalos"" made another appearance in English in ""omphaloskepsis,"" meaning ""contemplation of one's navel,"" but this word is relatively rare.",

pabulum,noun,"1: food; especially : a suspension or solution of nutrients in a state suitable for absorption  2: intellectual sustenance  3: something (as writing or speech) that is insipid, simplistic, or bland",,,,"""Pabulum"" derives from the Latin term for ""food"" or ""fodder"" and was first used in English in the 18th century for anything taken in by plants or animals to maintain life and growth.  Within 30 years of its first appearance in English texts, it was also being used to refer to things so intellectually stimulating or nourishing that they could be considered food for thought.  But the word took on a whole new flavor in the 1930s when a team of Canadian doctors formulated a highly nutritious (but bland) baby cereal and named their product Pablum (based on the Latin word).  As a result, the similar-looking ""pabulum"" did a linguistic about-face and is now often used for things that are bland and unstimulating as well as for things that are intellectually sustaining.",

These statutes, written in Anglo-French, opened with the words Purveu est and Purveu que, which translate literally as ""It is provided"" and ""Provided that.""  Purveu derives from porveu, the past participle of the Old French verb Porveeir, meaning ""to provide.""  Our word ""view"" derives from the past participle of another Anglo-French word, veer, meaning ""to see,"" and ultimately from the Latin videre, also meaning ""to see"" and an ancestor of porveeir.",

Retrosexual is a word that has been used in two very different ways.

It sometimes describes an old-fashioned ""manly man"" – e.g. a beer and football-loving guy who cares little for his appearance.

But it has also been used, as in the example above, to describe someone who self-consciously adopts traditional masculine styles – e.g. old-fashioned manners and clothes typical of the early 1960s (think Mad Men).",
